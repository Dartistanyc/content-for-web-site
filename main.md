# Roy Vanegas — Educator | Engineer | Animal Rights Advocate | Composer
I’ve been programming since 1996, and have been teaching since 2005. I teach, or have taught, Git, C, HTML, CSS, Gulp, JavaScript, PHP, Sass, Arduino, Processing, XML, MySQL, design, and thesis courses. I use Git, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Sass, and Gulp on daily basis. I’d call myself a full-stack engineer.

Between 2005 and 2013, I taught computer programming at a public college in New York City, and, in 2010, I founded that school’s web programming certificate, designing its curriculum and, at one point, teaching all nine of its courses.

I have taught at schools as varied as Columbia University and The New York Code + Design Academy. I’m summer faculty in the Summer Institute of Graphic Design Studies at Rhode Island School of Design, and part-time faculty in the Art Dept at Queens College. I also teach at BMCC and Touro College’s Graduate School of Technology.

I occasionally blog about web technologies at http://www.essential-html.com and discuss general issues at http://roy.vanegas.org/thoughts. I’m most active on GitHub.

As a designer, I have created flyers, electronics, including a wireless guitar pick and a six-channel audio installation, and web sites. My portfolio appears here. I occasionally fix cars and document the process.

I have worked as a tech lead or senior engineer at places such as NYU, IBM, and Consumer Reports, and have even taught at coding bootcamps, such as General Assembly and New York Code + Design Academy.

Academically speaking, after taking a break from both high school and college in my late teens to play music, I returned to academia in the late 90s, attending Queensborough Community College and earning a liberal arts degree with a minor in mathematics. I then attended Columbia University for three years before earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in computer science and music from Hunter College. I continued my studies at NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts, earning a Master of Professional Studies degree with a concentration in interactive computer music. I also studied composition at Queens College’s Aaron Copland School of Music.

## Teacher
I began teaching in 2005, cutting my teeth, as they say, at Hunter College’s Continuing Education Department. I now teach at undergraduate and graduate divisions of colleges throughout the tri-state area. In 2013, I began teaching at The Code Educators, assuming the role of lead instructor.

Some of the courses I currently teach—or have taught—are listed below, and a full listing appears here.

## Student
As a graduate student at NYU between 2006—2010, I documented some of the projects I worked on and wrote some tutorials. The link provided here leads you to the site as it was written in 2009—2010.

## Composer
I’ve composed music my entire adult life, but didn’t get serious about it until 2004, when I discovered the Cubase DAW. I compose electronic music under the artist moniker Noise Floor Music and new classical music under my own name. A list of compositions and scores is forthcoming.
